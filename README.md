# Task_Retail-analytics-end-to-end-project
This project delivers an end-to-end retail analytics workflow for SmartMart, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, Apriori-based association rule mining, SQL-driven stock insights, and Power BI dashboards.
Using Python (Pandas + mlxtend), Excel, SQL, and Power BI, the project uncovers product-pair patterns, top-selling items, customer behavior, and store optimization opportunities.
Deliverables include cleaned datasets, Python scripts, SQL queries, dashboards, and business recommendations for item bundling, shelf placement, and better inventory decisions.
